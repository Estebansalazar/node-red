# Watson Node-RED Services Basic Example Labs

In this section, Watson services are highlighted. The labs will show you how you can use the services in Node-RED.
The labs require that you have instances of the Watson services you need. For instructions on how to instantiate
and use the Watson services inside Node-RED follow this link.

- [Using Watson Services](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/node-red-labs/tree/master/basic_examples/using_watson_services)

NOTE : All the labs listed below assume that you have first created an Application from the customised [Node-RED Starter Boilerplate](http://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/node-red-bluemix-starter). If you have used the [IBM Cloud Node-RED Starter Boilerplate](../introduction_to_node_red/README.md) then you may find that not all the nodes area available on the Node-RED pallete. If you have instantiated the IBM Cloud boilerplate and would like to incorporate the latest Watson nodes then please follow the instructions [here](../watson_contribution_nodes/README.md)

In the list below, you can select different services and see how these can be implemented in Node-RED

- [Natural Language Understanding](natural_language_understanding/README.md)
- [Personality Insights](personality_insights/README.md)
- [Speech to Text](speech_to_text/README.md)
- [Speech to Text Customization](speech_to_text_custom/README.md)
